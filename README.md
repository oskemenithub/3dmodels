# Oskemen IT Hub - Student 3D Models

Welcome to the Oskemen IT Hub Student 3D Models repository! Here you will find a collection of 3D models representing the students from the Oskemen IT Hub community. These models can be used for various purposes, including educational projects, animations, virtual reality experiences, and more.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

.  
├── models/  
│ ├── student_1/  
│ │ ├── model_file.obj  
│ │ ├── textures/  
│ │ │ ├── texture_1.png  
│ │ │ └── texture_2.png  
│ │ └── README.md  
│ ├── student_2/  
│ │ ├── model_file.obj  
│ │ ├── textures/  
│ │ │ ├── texture_1.png  
│ │ │ └── texture_2.png  
│ │ └── README.md  
│ └── ...  
└── README.md  


- The `models/` directory contains subdirectories for each student, named `student_1/`, `student_2/`, and so on, representing individual student models.
- Each student's directory contains the main model file (`model_file.obj`) and a `textures/` directory, which holds any associated textures required for the model's appearance.
- Every student's directory also includes a `README.md` file providing additional information about the student, such as their name, background, interests, or any specific details about the model.

## Usage

Feel free to use these 3D models in your projects, subject to the terms and conditions specified in the [License](#license) section. You can import the models into various 3D modeling software, game engines, virtual reality environments, or any other compatible platforms.

To use a specific student's 3D model, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the corresponding student's directory in the `models/` folder.
2. Download the `model_file.obj` and the associated textures from the `textures/` directory if available.
3. Import the model into your preferred software or environment, ensuring that the textures are correctly linked or applied.

Remember to credit the Oskemen IT Hub and the respective student when using their 3D models. It's a great way to acknowledge their contributions and encourage further collaboration.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the Oskemen IT Hub community and beyond. If you are a student from Oskemen IT Hub and would like to have your 3D model included in this repository, please follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Create a new directory in the `models/` folder, naming it after yourself or using a unique identifier.
3. Add your 3D model file (preferably in `.obj` format) to the newly created directory.
4. Include any associated textures in a `textures/` subdirectory within your model's directory.
5. Create a `README.md` file within your model's directory, providing information about yourself, your interests, and any relevant details about the model.
